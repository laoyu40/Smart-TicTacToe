# Smart-TicTacToe
## English Introduce
    I coded this project with Scratch3.0. It's a casual game. 
    This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that requires two people to play. 
    However, after choosing the place to play chess,
    the player needs to answer a question in order to successfully set  the position of the chess pieces.
    If you answer the question incorrectly,
    the opponent's chess piece will appear in this position on the chessboard.
## 中文介绍
    这个项目是我用Scratch3.0编写的，它是一个休闲游戏。
    这是一个需要双人玩的井字棋游戏。但是在选择落子后，
    玩家需要回答一道问题，才能成功落下自己的棋子。
    如果问题回答错误，棋盘上的这个位置将会出现对方的棋子。
